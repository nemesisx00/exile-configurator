# About Exile Configurator #
Exile Configurator is a utility application developed primarily to assist in configuring additional mod items/equipment/vehicles for use in the ArmA 3 modification Exile Mod ([http://www.exilemod.com/](http://www.exilemod.com/)).

As anyone who has attempted to set up an Exile Mod server with additional weapon or vehicle packs will surely know, there is a lot of busywork involved in setting up the vendor lists and loot tables. Hopefully, this application will grow to make this process faster and easier.
